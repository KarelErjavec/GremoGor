# Profile Pictures

This directory contains profile pictures for users.

## Default Profile Picture

The `default-profile.jpg` file is used as a placeholder for users who haven't uploaded their own profile picture.

To replace it with a real image:
1. Create or find a square image (recommended size: 200x200 pixels)
2. Save it as `default-profile.jpg` in this directory
3. Make sure the file is a valid JPG image

## User Profile Pictures

In the future, when implementing user profile picture uploads, you can store them in this directory with a naming convention like `username.jpg` or `user_id.jpg`.
